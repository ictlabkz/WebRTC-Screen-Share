Common issues & queries

Recursive cascade images or blurred screen experiences occur only when you try to share screen between two tabs on the same system. This NEVER happens when sharing between unique systems or devices.  Remember, it is not desktop sharing! It is just a state-less screen sharing. Desktop sharing is possible only through native (C++) applications.
